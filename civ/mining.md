# Mining

> Mining is a fundamental core activity that will be used for many of the crafting tables around the city. While this can be tedious, and a bit of a grind, this is where you will spend quite a bit of time in order to level up your crafting abilities!

> Here you'll be able to break apart rocks to fill buckets of dirt that you can then process in the trommel. While processing your dirt you will receive the selected ore that you are searching for, as well as gem rocks that can be broken up for the chance to find valuable gems.

Before beginning at the mining area you may discover that you will first need to gather some materials to build buckets, as well as a shovel, or pickaxe. Make sure that you visit the recycling center to grab a few!
