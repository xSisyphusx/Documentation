# Mining

> Mining is a fundamental core activity that will be used for many of the crafting tables around the city. While this can be tedious, and a bit of a grind, this is where you will spend quite a bit of time in order to level up your crafting abilities!  Here you'll be able to break apart rocks to fill buckets of dirt that you can then process in the trommel. While processing your dirt you will receive the selected ore that you are searching for, as well as gem rocks that can be broken up for the chance to find valuable gems.

Before beginning at the mining area you may discover that you will first need to gather some materials to build buckets, as well as a shovel, or pickaxe. Make sure that you visit the recycling center to grab a few! 
{% endhint %}

> Once you've crafted yourself some empty buckets, and a mining tool (Shovel, Pickaxe, Jackhammer) you can move over to the mining pit where you'll find several large boulders that you can mine. Each boulder will afford you between 1 and 3 filled buckets. Each mining tool will allow you to perform this action at specific speeds. The Shovel being the slowest, the jackhammer being the fastest and the pickaxe being right in the middle. 

> After you have filled your buckets you can then take your filled buckets to the trommel to process your dirt. Here you will be presented with several options on what kind of ore you would like to process the dirt to find. Along with this you can select how many filled buckets you would like to use for each ore type. Once completed you will be given the ore you selected along with some gem rocks if you get lucky! 

> That's it! You are now a professional miner. With some time and effort you'll be crafting with the best of them!
