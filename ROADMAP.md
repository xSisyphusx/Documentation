## Notes

* **Daily Updates**: At the end of each development day, a summary of progress, challenges, and next steps will be documented and shared with the team. This ensures transparency and keeps everyone aligned with the project's status.
* **Progress Reports**: Detailed progress reports will be compiled weekly, highlighting completed tasks, ongoing work, and any deviations from the planned roadmap. These reports will be reviewed in team meetings to address any issues promptly.
* **Issue Tracking**: Any issues or blockers encountered during development will be logged and tracked in a centralized system. Daily updates will include the status of these issues and the steps being taken to resolve them.
* **Feedback Loop**: Feedback from daily updates will be collected and analyzed to make necessary adjustments to the development process, ensuring continuous improvement and alignment with project goals.

## Protocol for Adjustments

> Adjustments to the roadmap may occur based on project needs and feedback. The following processes will be followed to manage changes:

* **Feedback Collection**: Regularly gather feedback from stakeholders, including developers, users, and project managers.
* **Impact Analysis**: Assess the impact of proposed changes on the project timeline, resources, and overall goals.
* **Approval Process**: Changes must be reviewed and approved by the project management team before implementation.
* **Communication**: Communicate approved changes to all relevant parties and update the roadmap accordingly.
* **Documentation**: Maintain detailed records of all changes, including the rationale and expected outcomes.

> By following these steps, we ensure that the roadmap remains flexible and responsive to evolving project requirements while maintaining clarity and alignment with our objectives.
