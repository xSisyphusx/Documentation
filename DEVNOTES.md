# Development Notes

## Daily Updates
# 12/20/2024
**Notation:** Missed the last couple of days of updating this, as I don't think that anyone is really reading this shit anyways but here's one for today.
- **Date:** 12/20/2024
- **Summary of Progress:**
  > [S2] Feature F is still under way. Many of the items have been created and I have begun working on other pieces of the feature. Primarily I have written a mining script that allows for players to being crafting items utilizing metals. This at the time is limited to Iron, Copper, and Gold. I have also developed an Auction House script that will allow players to buy and sell their materials. In this way all items inherent values will be determined by the necessity of them in other crafting recipes, and their level at the crafting tables. This will make easy to obtain items worth less, and difficult to craft items worth more. 

  > As of the moment of typing this, only the Mining Script is fully functional. 
- **Challenges:**
  > No Challenges were noted during this coding session.
- **Next Steps:**
  > Next steps will be to continue creating the crafting tables, and making sure that the auction house script is functional. That will be the primary goal moving forward. 

# 12/15/2024
**Notation:** I will be writing more moving forward based on the Testing team's feedback in future updates. 

* **Date:** 12/15/2024
*   **Summary of Progress:**

    > \[S2] Feature F is well under way. I have been steadily adding more and more items that will be utilized for building the server into a crafting forward experience for all players. This will be much more well noted in areas such as businesses, as well as day to day necessities in the server.

    > My main focus the last couple of days with these items is handling calling client and server sided exports from the item themselves in order to make a condusive roleplay experience from start to finish. For example, instead of developing more external scripts to handle item functions, I have successfully been able to use the inventory system to successfully run the functions at the time of the item's usage.
*   **Challenges:**

    > A couple of road blocks have been noted with things such as prop rotation in animations produced from client sided functions inside the items, however, this is only a minor setback and something that can be focused on after the launch of 2.5.0.
*   **Next Steps:**

    > Next steps is simply to continue plugging away on \[S2] Feature F. This will surely be the thing that takes the absolute longest. I was hoping that this would only take me a couple of weeks, but more and more it's seeming likely that I may not finish on time.

    > Regardless I'm going to continue to push further and further into this project with the hopes that when it's released Redux Roleplay will finally be recognized as a destination.
