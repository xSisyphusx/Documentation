# Development Notes

## Daily Updates
# 12/15/2024
**Notation:** I will be writing more moving forward based on the Testing team's feedback in future updates. 

- **Date:** 12/15/2024
- **Summary of Progress:**
  > [S2] Feature F is well under way. I have been steadily adding more and more items that will be utilized for building the server into a crafting forward experience for all players. This will be much more well noted in areas such as businesses, as well as day to day necessities in the server.

  > My main focus the last couple of days with these items is handling calling client and server sided exports from the item themselves in order to make a condusive roleplay experience from start to finish. For example, instead of developing more external scripts to handle item functions, I have successfully been able to use the inventory system to successfully run the functions at the time of the item's usage. 

- **Challenges:**
  > A couple of road blocks have been noted with things such as prop rotation in animations produced from client sided functions inside the items, however, this is only a minor setback and something that can be focused on after the launch of 2.5.0.

- **Next Steps:**
  > Next steps is simply to continue plugging away on [S2] Feature F. This will surely be the thing that takes the absolute longest. I was hoping that this would only take me a couple of weeks, but more and more it's seeming likely that I may not finish on time. 

  > Regardless I'm going to continue to push further and further into this project with the hopes that when it's released Redux Roleplay will finally be recognized as a destination.
