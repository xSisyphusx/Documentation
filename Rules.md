## Rules

**Welcome To Redux**

Redux Redux has provided this website in order to provide an organized space for members of the community to review the rules of the server.\
Any changes made to the rules of the server will be paired with an announcement in our Discord.

It is your responsibility to stay up-to-date with the rules of Redux.\
The Redux Staff Team reserves the rights to make decisions in the best interest of the server.

The contents of this website were written for explicit use within the Redux community.\
The contents of this document may not be duplicated by, or distributed to any unauthorized party in any way without prior explicit approval from a Redux Owner.

**Redux is not officially approved, sponsored, or endorsed by Rockstar Games.**

***

### Warning Schedule

Redux employs the following warning schedule. Staff of Redux reserve the right to defer from this warning schedule at times deemed necessary.

| Warning Number | Punishment                                          |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 1st Warning    | Documented                                          |
| 2nd Warning    | 48 Hour Ban                                         |
| 3rd Warning    | 3 Day Ban                                           |
| 4th Warning    | 7 Day Ban                                           |
| 5th Warning    | 10 Day Ban                                          |
| 6th Warning    | Permanent ban, can file a ban appeal after 30 days. |

Redux Staff reserves the right to issue warnings to anything they deem necessary even if it is not labeled in the rules.\
Those who try to find gray areas or know they probably shouldn’t do something but do it anyways saying “it’s technically not in the rules” are subject to the warning schedule.

In accordance with the rules, the following rule breaks count for two warnings:

* RDM
* Combat Logging

Redux Staff reserves the right to deviate from the warning schedule in the event of serious rule breaks.

Warnings reset at the start of each new quarter. Bans started in previous quarters will run their full course,\
regardless of if the new quarter has begun (i.e. – if you are placed on a 3 day ban on March 31, you will still be banned until April 2nd).

| Quarter #   | Months             |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| 1st Quarter | January - March    |
| 2nd Quarter | April - June       |
| 3rd Quarter | July - September   |
| 4th Quarter | October - December |

**Whitelist Jobs**

If you would like to have a whitelisted job role, such as police, ems, or D8 we will require that you do not fly into any other cities. If you would like to fly into multiple cities you will need to forfeit your whitelist job entirely. This is to ensure that we have active and attentive services that are not stretching themselves too thinly across multiple servers.

**Business SOPs**

This SOP must be read and understood prior to submitting your application for a business within Redux. Please direct questions regarding this business SOP to a General Support ticket in Discord.

NOTE: All business owners must only play in Redux. As we encourage business owners to be the most active person at their business, players are not permitted to own businesses if they play in other FiveM Servers

* Strive to open during main each night.
* Owner should be the most active employee.
* Team must complete at least 5 hours a week in order to not be terminated.
  * Owners must strive to keep a well-staffed business.

## **Org/Gang SOPs**

NOTE: Gang Leaders for orgs/gangs in Redux must only play in Redux. As we value consistent activity, we will not permit gang leaders to start a gang if they currently play in other FiveM Servers.

**1. Application**
* Activity is imperative to running a business. Below are the minimum requirements to keep your business open:
  * To establish a gang or org, an application must be submitted via our Website. Applications will be reviewed by staff, and the owner of the gang will be contacted via a ticket to schedule an interview.
* App Prerequisites:
  * The org owner must have been whitelisted in Redux for at least 14 days.
  * The org must have at least 5 members at the time of application.
* If your application is denied, you must wait a minimum of 30 days before re-applying.


**2. Probationary Period**
* After a gang interview is completed with an owner, the org may begin establishing their presence in the city. During this 14 day probationary period, no boss menu or clothing/items will be added for the gang. Staff will evaluate the RP produced by the gang to determine its viability. At the end of the 14 day period, gangs will either be officially implemented into the city or asked to reapply after 30 days. Any member that is in a whitelisted gang in another city will be banned, and will cause their gang a strike.


**3. Submitting Clothing or Item Requests**
- To request items, clothing, or other additions to a gang, the owner must submit a request to staff utilizing developer tickets.
- You will be allowed to purchase other things for the gang/city, requests for additional items or clothing may be made via developer tickets.

* In addition to a written roster, Discord role requests must be submitted in #role-requests for all members of the gang.
* **Gang members who leave their gang must wait 30 days before joining another.**


**5. Disbandment**
* If your org disbands for any reason, the org owner must inform staff via a Gang Support Ticket.
* Staff reserves the right to disband orgs at any time.
  * 5.1. Ownership Transfers
    * If a gang owner leaves their gang, a ticket must be opened by the owner or one representative of the org to transfer ownership. Failure to report ownership changes could result in disbandment.
  * 5.2. Coups
    * In the event an org owner becomes inactive or ownership is challenged by the org, a coup may be attempted. A ticket must be opened by one representative of the gang, and evidence that 75% of gang members support the coup must be provided. If the coup attempt is approved, a new owner should be named by the gang in the ticket.

**6. Expectations**
* Interactions between a gang and solos, whitelisted jobs, or other gangs must completely satisfy all server rules. Additionally, gangs should strive to provide quality interactions beyond the minimum required.
* There is no such thing as “on-sight” initiation. Each scene requires interaction.


**7. Groups & Alliances**
* Gangs can form contracts with other gangs or solo individuals. The total number of people involved in one scene must not be more than 6. Refer to Limitations of Gangs for any exceptions to this rule.

## Ticket System

**Ticket System**

Redux utilizes a custom Discord Bot within Discord to handle all user-to-user support. We do not handle in-city reports, or handle server business within direct messages. To access our support system, please head to the **#help-desk** channel in Discord.

Our ticket systems utilize specific permissions to ensure key information is not lost. When presented with the form from The Ticket System, please fill out the form in its entirety. If you do not fill out the form properly, your ticket will be closed without notice. Thank you for your cooperation.

Thank you for your cooperation.


**Receiving Transcripts**
* Our ticket system is designed to ensure you receive a transcript after every ticket you open. The transcript provides you with a full recount of what was said in the ticket so you can refer to it as needed. In order to receive transcripts, you must allow DMs from the Redux Discord Server. To make sure this is set up correctly, follow these steps:
  1. Open Discord and next to the name of the server, click on the down arrow.
  2. Select “Privacy Settings”.
  3. Make sure that Direct Messages are toggled ON.



**1. In-City Report Tickets**
* In-city Report tickets are to report rule breaks and exploits in-city. You must meet all reporting requirements, as outlined in Reporting Requirements.

**2. General Support Tickets**
* General Support Tickets are for non-city reports. This includes getting the Content Creator role, questions about supporting the server through Tebex, questions about businesses, etc.

**3. Events Tickets**
*   The Events Ticket is where you can bring your own in-city event to life with the help of our Events Team. Events must be completely approved from our team and promoted no less than two (2) days in advance. If you choose to run an unsanctioned event, you must let the RP flow as it does.

**4. Developer Tickets**
* Developer Tickets are for reporting bugs within the city, or discussing scripts.  

**5. Clothing Developer Tickets**
* Use this ticket to discuss additions for clothing or updates to clothing with clothing dev.

**6. Vehicle Developer Tickets**
*  Use this ticket to discuss additions for vehicles or updates to vehicles with vehicle dev.

**Reporting Issues**

In order to keep the city as immersive as possible, staff will ONLY handle reports within the ticket system of the Discord server. All players, whether or not they are content creators, are strongly encouraged to run some sort of recording software. Make sure that this software is capturing your gameplay AND your microphone!

Staff will ONLY handle in-city assists in the event of a serious rule break (harassment, use of slurs in-city, racism, etc.).

If you are in a scene and notice a rulebreak, please do the following:

* Let the scene play out. Do not break character.
* Do not inform the player that they are breaking a rule.
* Capture the player’s ID, Name, or Identity.

##### Information disclosed in any Redux Support ticket is confidential, and is to remain confidential between the ticket owner and the Redux Staff Team. Sharing the contents of tickets to outside parties, including on stream, may result in warning points being issued.

**Reporting Requirements**

In order for your reports to be reviewed, you must meet the following requirements. Staff reserves the right to close out tickets that fail to meet requirements.

* Making sure that your gameplay can be seen.
* Making sure your in-game audio can be heard.
* Making sure your microphone can be heard.
* Your clip must show at least 2 minutes prior to the rule break. This shows staff what led up to the rule break, which could impact the final verdict.
  * If you are using a stream to make reports, please be sure of the following:
    * You were involved with the scene in question. You can not report things seen in streams that you were not a part of.
    * You have a time stamp within the stream, as well as a link to the VOD.
* You must get the in-city IDs/ Names / Identities of the people involved.
* You must fill out the form presented by the ticket in its entirety, and with a fair amount of detail.
* In-city reports should be made as soon as possible after the conclusion of the scene. Reports made more than 48 hours after the scene has concluded will not be reviewed.
* **FAILURE TO MEET REPORTING REQUIREMENTS MAY RESULT IN YOUR TICKET BEING CLOSED WITHOUT NOTICE. HELP STAFF HELP YOU.**

**General Chat Rules**

* Everyone is to be respected at all times. Toxicity will not be tolerated.
* Racism, sexism, homophobia, transcphobia, neo-nazism, and any other form of extremism or hate speech will NOT be tolerated.
* Monitors and ALL staff have the final say in moderation here, just as they do in the city. Listen to what we say and follow it, or you may end up in a position where you could be subject to a warning, per the warning schedule.
* General chat is NOT a place to discuss things from the city. It is an OOC (out-of-character) channel.
* If you have a question or you need help, please open a ticket in the #help-desk channel of Discord. General chat is not a support channel.

## In City Rules

**Voice Rules**

* A working, quality microphone is required.
* Push to talk (PTT) must be enabled both in-city and in Discord.
* Players must be able to verbally communicate for an immersive role-playing experience. Any exceptions must be made by the staff team via a ticket.
* English is the designated language for communication in the server at all times.
* Voice Changers are permitted, but must be of a high-quality. Staff reserves the right to deny usage of voice changers in the city.

**RDM (Random Deathmatch) and VDM (Vehicle Deathmatch)**

##### Players must engage in ample roleplay before shooting, killing, or using a vehicle as a weapon.

* Any injury or death without roleplay leading up to it may be classified as Random Death Match (RDM) or Vehicular Death Match (VDM).
* Killing without proper initiation will result in a warning for RDM. As a result of this rule, there is no such thing as “on-sight” killing in Redux.
* Even in times of a gang war, there is no such thing as kill-on-sight.
* **Warnings for RDM count as two (2) warnings.**

**Breaking Character**

##### Also known as going OOC (out-of-character).

* In the event of an issue, completely play out the scene, then open an In City Report Ticket with a video clip. Refer to Reporting Issues for things to be on the lookout for and do.
* This also includes speaking about government situations that occurred in tickets or in the city. Government scenes are considered outside of RP so should not be discussed in character.
* Any discussion about a scene you were involved with when you wake up at the light is prohibited and is considered breaking character.
* “Rulesplaining” in city is considered breaking character.
* Usage of terms like “bible”, “prayer”, etc., may be considered breaking character. Let scenes play out. You shouldn’t need to mention that things are against the bible or that you are sending up a prayer. If you are in a situation where you find that you do need to make a in-city report ticket, please do so without mentioning it in city.

**Combat Logging**

##### Combat Logging

* Combat Logging is strictly prohibited.
* You cannot leave the city to save your inventory, or to respawn before the allotted time.
  * This includes disconnecting to avoid PD custody, being looted by rivals, etc.
* When engaged in active RP scenes, players shall not disconnect from the server until the scenario has completely ended.
* For the sake of consistency, this rule cannot be overlooked on the notion that someone was about to fly out or disconnect.
* Characters involved in criminal activity must be completely clear of any law enforcement before disconnecting.
* Accidental disconnects, connection interruptions, or crashes should be communicated via a the #headpop Channel in Discord IMMEDIATELY.
* **Combat Logging counts for 2 warnings.**

**Fail RP and Low Quality RP (LQRP)**

* Do not do things that you would not do in the real world.
  * Staff acknowledges that as a crime-based RP server, this is discretionary. Simply, the RP must be realistic to a criminal.
* You must act out your injuries after being treated by EMS meaning that running, jumping, shooting etc after being treated by EMS is unrealistic.
* FailRP/Low Quality RP: Actions that are unrealistic or hurt the roleplay experience of other players are considered as fail roleplay, however, not all actions that may seem unrealistic are punishable.
* Example of LQRP/FRP: Taking an enemy vehicle and stripping the upgrades off of it.
* Example of LQRP/FRP: Using the mechanic tablet outside of your shop, unless doing basic repairs to be able to get the vehicle to the shop.
* Example of LQRP/FRP: Failing to respond to /me interactions of other players, such as /me takes off mask or /me steals shoes.
* Entering PD with the sole intent to commit a crime. This is not only Fail RP but is also cop baiting, and a lack of value for your life. No one would realistically enter a police station just to cause mayhem, without the expectation of being seriously injured or killed.
* Example of LQRP/FRP: Talking normally after you have gunshot wounds. To avoid salt, attempt to RP your injuries out by reacting as you’ve been shot rather than engaging in conversation with the other party. This includes giving communications while down.
* Example of LQRP/FRP: Using a tazer to pop a tire on a vehicle.
* Example of LQRP/FRP: Spectating a shootout
* Example of LQRP/FRP: Robbing someone without sufficient roleplay, including cops.
* Example of LQRP/FRP: Using the same shootout location in a short amount of tim

**MetaGaming**

* Metagaming is strictly prohibited.
* Metagaming is defined as utilizing out-of-character knowledge for in-character benefit or gain.
  * This includes any knowledge gained from external programs such as streams, Discord, TeamSpeak, or forums.
  * You cannot share information between characters, regardless of how they are “related.”
* Utilizing player-unique identifiers or OOC chat for personal gain is also prohibited.
* Because staff cannot differentiate being in a stream to say “hi” versus observing for personal gain, even briefly watching a stream while in the city is a violation of the rules.
* **IF YOU ARE CAUGHT STREAM SNIPING, YOU WILL INSTANTLY BE BANNED.**

**Hate Speech**

##### While we realize that GTA V is rated M17+, we will not allow the use of slurs, hate speech, or discriminatory remarks against members of the community as it pertains to their race, religion, sexual orientation, mental health, physical health, etc. Violations of this rule will be judged accordingly by the staff team.

* Trash talk is allowed, but should not become personal in nature, taken out of character, or toxic in nature.
  * We acknowledge that certain parties may be offended by certain vernacular that others are not. These scenes must be reviewed on a discretionary basis.
  * It is important to use good judgment and common sense in communicating with other players.

**Gun Fear and Valuing your life**

* You must fear for your life when a gun is pointed at you.
  * The gun must be out AND pointed at you, meaning that if the gun is out but not pointed, you are not required to fear it.
  * The person who draws a gun and AIMS it first is the person who is in charge of the roleplay.
  * You must comply with the demands of anyone taking you hostage at gunpoint, even if it results in your death.
* You do not have to value the lives of other people unless dictated by additional SOP regulations.
* In order to take someone hostage:
  * You must physically have a gun pointed to their head.
  * You must take them on foot.
  * You cannot do it from inside a car or on a bike.
  * You cannot ask them to be your hostage. It’s not a choice.
* When attempting to take someone hostage who is in a vehicle:
  * They are allowed to flee in fear for their life.
  * If a driver runs you over in retaliation for the attempt to take them hostage, it is considered self-defense and not VDM.
* When taking a hostage, you need to be courteous of the amount of time you hold them for, as to not limit their RP.
  * You cannot have a friend be your hostage.
  * You cannot use the same hostage for back-to-back robberies or scenes.
  * You cannot ask someone to be your hostage. It’s not a choice.

**Staff Disrespect**

* Staff disrespect is not tolerated. If you are argumentative and/or hot-headed with staff, you may be issued a warning.
* Do not contact server owners regarding punishments you have received from staff.
  * If you would like to appeal a warning you were issued, you may open a General Support Ticket in Discord and tag the Community Manager. Make sure you submit video evidence, as well as all of the information that may be needed to make a decision.
* Threatening to leave the city, or any other version of “I’m going to to this or else”, for any reason will be handled by the staff with an immediate ban from the city. Whether this is because you want something and didn’t get it, or someone you don’t like is also in the city. We will not be extorted by ANY player for ANY reason. If you don’t want to be in this city don’t be.
* Failure to abide by these rules are punishable by admin warnings.

**Downed but Revived**

* If you are downed in a scene, once revived by EMS you must leave the scene completely.
* You can not loot and/or assist anyone.

* You can not bring dead bodies out of the scene.

* You must leave the scene right away.
* If you are downed and taken to the hospital for medical attention, you can not return to the scene/location/situation for 15 minutes.
* You can not go back to the area for any reason. (For example: if you’re downed at the mechanic shop, you can not return there for at least 15 minutes, even if you need a repair)
* If you are revived, you can remember the situation. The only time you can not is if you go to the light and/or you get ocean dumped. See New Life Rule.

**New Life Rule**

* If you are declared dead or respawn at the light, you cannot:
  * Remember the situation you were involved with which caused your death.
  * Return to the situation/scene/area in which you died for fifteen (15) minutes.
  * Partake in that scene or address those who killed you for the same reason.
* To be reminded of a situation, a separate party must provide clear details of what happened – only the exact information they provide can be used.
* Old messages, pictures, Tweets, etc. cannot be utilized to remember the scene in its entirety. Only the information directly retrievable from the message/image can be recalled.
* You cannot place notes in people’s pockets, send yourself a text message, or anything of that nature to be reminded.
  * This includes texting yourself before entering a scene to remember it.
  * This includes leaving yourself a note in your storage.
* You can not go to the light to avoid an RP scenario. If you are killed in a shootout, you can not go to the light to avoid being robbed. You CAN, however, go to the light if they are carrying you around with no clear objective. You can only go to the light after acting out your injuries.

**Revealing Locations**

* You cannot reveal “secret” locations, such as drug spots, to the entire city, for example, via Twitter.
* You are allowed to give or sell locations to individuals through RP.

**Suicide RP**

* Suicide roleplay is not allowed.
* Someone pointing a gun at you and demanding you to jump off a building is not suicide RP.
* This will result in an **AUTOMATIC 48 Hour Ban**

**Usage of external Aim Software, Macros, Etc**

* Software to improve your aim, heal hacks, duping, macros, etc. are all strictly forbidden, and if caught, will result in serious consequences up to a permanent ban.
* External crosshairs, such as Crosshair X, are permitted for use.
* The use of the Flawless Widescreen application while in-city is strictly prohibited. Any application that provides a similar advantage of manipulating the game’s visuals or mechanics to gain an unfair advantage is also prohibited.

## **Cop Fear and Police Rules**

**Cop Baiting**
* Cop baiting is not allowed.
  * No committing crimes directly in front of a police officer with the intent of a chase.
  * This is discretionary, based on video evidence provided in the report.
  * This includes taking hostages in the obvious presence of officers. This is discretionary.
  * Additional instances of this include flashing illegal items/weapons in the obvious presence of police officers.
* You can not bait a LEO, or lead a chase with an LEO to a compound in order to outnumber them.

**General Police Rules**
* Suspects must comply with officers’ demands at gunpoint, per cop fear.
  * Exceptions to this rule include:
  * Banks, store robberies, and jewelry, Etc
  * When criminals involved in the scene (Not at a Bank, Store, Or other heist style scene) sufficiently outnumber the police on scene, allowing the criminals to enact gun fear rules on the police instead.
* Once in police custody and handcuffed, you cannot empty your pockets into vehicles, other people, etc.
* You can take an officer hostage.
* We do not accept the “Fuck 12” Rhetoric or cop bashing. Just because you’re salty that you got caught does not give you the right to use salty behavior to abuse the police. It does not matter if you say it to their faces or not – it’s not okay. If you can’t do the time without being a whiny shitlord, then don’t do crime.
* Note that it is the officer’s responsibility to ask about outside help or vehicles.
  * If officers do not ask and help is present, it may still be used.
* Officers cannot remove licenses from dead bodies.
  * Licenses may only be removed from criminals when alive.
* Dirty cops are not tolerated.
  * Offenses may be punishable by a permanent ban.
  * An officer who accepts a bribe for a decrease in punishment or some information is not considered a dirty cop.
  * Officers who give/sell PD weapons or items will be considered dirty cops. This is strictly prohibited.
* Water chases should be a last-case scenario and should be brief.
* By the addition of prison transports, gun fear may be enacted upon officers to free a suspect being transported to the prison for a crime.
* You can not rob Police Officers of weapons for any reason. You may only loot police for things such as Bandages, Armor, or Ammo if you **NEED** it in order to escape the scene.
* You may cause crimes inside of the police department’s area, however, police will escalate force to lethal, or cuff you without warning. This is not a realistic measure of roleplay, and will be roleplayed out by the police but their methods for securing you will become swift, and not as fair as it would be outside of the police station. (This includes the police parking lot)

## **Limitations of Criminal Activities**

**Rule of 6**
##### The maximum number of players allowed to engage in player-versus-player (PvP) criminal activities is 6 at any given time. However, there are certain scenarios where more than 6 players may be allowed. For instance, if a group of 6 individuals initiates hostile actions against a larger group, all participants will be flagged for that particular role-playing scenario, allowing them to engage in natural role-play. It’s important to note that relaying information or communication between characters, such as acting as lookouts or using radio communications, will be counted as part of the scenario.

* Prison Break Interference
  * In the event that characters are taken into police custody and a second group of six forms to attempt a prison break or transport break, the second group must refrain from intervening until the prison transport begins. It is considered non-valued life (NVL) to interfere without a properly planned out strategy.
  * ONLY Prison busses can be contested. This is due to the fact that if a prisoner is in the bus headed to the prison that persons crimes they have committed could warrant their friends or family to try and set them free. Police only send the worse criminals who have committed many crimes to the penitentiary. Don’t waste your time or the pds time trying to contest a squad car that’s headed to court, etc. Those criminals will be back on the streets in the matter of minutes. The crimes those criminals have committed are not severe enough to warrant a contest. Wait for the bus.

* Heist Interference
  *Once another party has initiated a heist, it is prohibited to interfere with their operation.
* Gang Wars
  * During a gang war, Rule of 6 must be followed at all times, the only exception being the physical turf.
  * When contesting a territory, the rule of 6 applies for both orgs/gangs. The only time rule of 6 does not apply, is for an org defending their physical compound.

**Storm Limitations**
  * You can not initiate any new criminal activity within 15 minutes of a server restart. Any criminal activity started more than 15 minutes before a restart may be continued.

**Smash and Grabs**
* Smash and grabs are never permitted. You must wait for 10 minutes for a police response prior to leaving ANY robbery / heist. The only exclusion to this rule is Humane Labs, and Bobcat.


**Ocean Dumping Vehicles**
Due to Police having to purchase their own PD vehicles, it has been noted as “Scummy” or “Low Quality” to Ocean Dump Police Vehicles after a shootout/scene with the police. For that reason the following rules now apply to the situation:

Only one officer may go back to the scene to retrieve vehicles to the impound. This should be the highest commanding officer on duty.
If body cams are destroyed by default dash cams will be counted as destroyed also.
Upon returning to the scene, if the officer notices that there are still criminals in the area, the officer is to ignore any activities the criminals are doing. They are only there to retrieve the police vehicles.
Criminals will not harass, shoot at, or be toxic to the officer that returns for their vehicles.
The Officer Returning to the scene must also still follow the NLR of 15 minutes. They must not return to the scene until 15 minutes has passed to get their vehicles.
Any evidence in the area, or attached to the vehicles from the previous scene must be completely ignored.

**Cooldowns**
Cooldowns must be self imposed. The cooldowns begin once the robbery/heist is concluded, not at the beginning of the robbery/heist. If you begin a robbery or heist and fail the robbery, you must still impose the cooldown on yourself. You may not try again.

* Car Boosting
  * Cooldown: 20 Minutes.
* Store, ATM's, Fleeca Bank, Jewelry, Houses
  * Cooldown: 60 Minutes
* Paleto Bank
  * Cooldown: Once Per Storm
* PAC Bank
  * Cooldown: Once per 24 Hours
* Humane Labs
  * Cooldown: 10 Minutes  
(This is a Heist, not a Robbery. You do not have to wait for police to arrive for this)

**Bags / Banks / Phones**
##### When Robbing a Player you MAY take their bags, phones, or bank cards, but you are not allowed to force someone to give you their pin codes for these items. This will be viewed as FailRP, LQRP, as well as Powergaming.

**Receipt of Large Gifts**

* You should notify staff immediately, via a ticket, upon receiving a large amount of money, unapproved weapons, or a large unexpected gift from someone you do not know.
  * Failure to report such items may result in a warning or a ban.

**Robbing Rules**

* Robberies should not be conducted in safe zones (green zones).
  * Exemption: Scenes starting outside of the green zone and taken to the green zone (by fleeing the chase, etc.) are allowed to continue.
* You may access trunks with the proper RP, including situations such as:
  * Discovering an abandoned, unlocked vehicle.
  * Lockpicking a vehicle and RP-ing the vehicle robbery.
  * Initiation of a robbery, per gun fear and robbery rules.
  * **Note that you cannot force someone to take a vehicle out of a garage to access the trunk/vehicle.**
* You cannot take someone to an ATM to remove money, nor can you demand that they take items/cash from their org or house for a robbery.
* When in a vehicle chase, whether by PD or civilians, you must completely lose the party pursuing you before storing your vehicle away.
  * This rule includes running from PD during banks/other robberies.
  * This rule includes continuing to put your vehicle away, even if you’re already at the garage area.
  * If there is reasonable time to react to the robbery, then vehicle storage is not allowed, thus the robbery is fair game.
  * **Note such instances are often discretionary.**
* Houses, vehicles, businesses, etc. (including whitelisted areas, where applicable) may be robbed/utilized if left unlocked.
  * You cannot camp a location for the purpose of robbing them.
  * Crime zones (drug locations, the black market, etc.) are included.
* You cannot kill somebody that you have robbed.
  * You can, however, kill them if they are continually talking smack during your scene.
* Rat looting/lootboxing is prohibited. You can not rob people who were killed from a scene that you were not involved with.
* You can not go to the light to avoid a RP scenario. If you are killed in a shootout, you can not go to the light to avoid being robbed. You CAN, however, go to the light if they are carrying you around with no clear objective. You can only go to the light after acting out your injuries.
* Members that are bled out or voluntarily leave an org cannot rob the org of its items or funds.
* Employees that are fired or voluntarily quit a business cannot rob the business of its items or funds.

  * Impersonation includes utilizing LEO/EMS uniforms or vests.
* Whitelisted jobs can be kidnapped.
  * You can enact gun fear on whitelisted jobs, regardless of the number on duty.
  * Included in this rule is telling EMS to leave a scene or “holding up” officers for certain RP situations.
    * “Holding up” officers may include freeing someone from custody, forcing an officer to leave a scene, making demands, etc.
* Whitelisted jobs cannot be looted of their job-specific items for personal gain.
  * This includes looting EMS of medical kits.
* EMS cannot remind citizens of who killed them.
* You must provide adequate roleplay to those in EMS. This includes:
  * Acting out your injuries, or utilizing /me commands if you choose to be unconscious.
  * Responding to their questions or actions, such as acting as if you are sedated when they say you are sedated.
* You can not use the light to avoid prison time. Once engaged by LEOs, CPR is not needed.

**Powergaming**

##### Powergaming is the act of exploiting mechanics that are not intended or supported within Redux for personal gain, or forcing other players into scenes where there are little-to-no choices for input into the scene.

* The use of third-party applications like Flawless Widescreen, or any tool or modification that grants an unfair advantage by altering the game’s visuals or mechanics, will result in a warning for powergaming.
* Flying into other cities and keybinding removed emotes in order to use them in Redux will result in a warning for powergaming.
* Using in-city IDs in order to identify players for non-report reasons, or to show their location within proximity.
* **Staff reserves the right to issue powergaming warnings for actions not specifically listed on this page.**

**Fine Print and Disclaimers**

##### Staff Reserves the right to remove people from the server for any reason they see fit, including but not limited to: Defaming the server in any manner, spreading false rumors about the server in any manner, or making statements in bad faith about staff without bringing it to the proper ticket channels. These rules are a guideline, though, if for any reason you are found to not be a suitable member of this community you will be removed. Any purchases are non-refundable and voided upon your departure. Once you leave the discord your cars / houses / clothing / etc. may be resold.

##### The server database is set to automatically delete characters that have not signed in after 30 days. This automation is run once every 60 days. If your character is deleted, and you have not opened a ticket prior to your absence, your items, including any purchased items from the coin shop in city will not be returned. Your character is your responsibility. If for any reason you need to be gone for an extended period of time, it is your responsibility to inform staff of this, as well as any items you would like to be noted.
