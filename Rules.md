## Warning Schedule

Redux employs the following warning schedule. Staff of Redux reserve the right to defer from this warning schedule at times deemed necessary.

| Warning Number | Punishment |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 1st Warning | Documented |
| 2nd Warning | 48 Hour Ban |
| 3rd Warning | 3 Day Ban |
| 4th Warning | 7 Day Ban |
| 5th Warning | 10 Day Ban |
| 6th Warning | Permanent ban, can file a ban appeal after 30 days. |

Redux Staff reserves the right to issue warnings to anything they deem necessary even if it is not labeled in the rules.  
Those who try to find gray areas or know they probably shouldn’t do something but do it anyways saying “it’s technically not in the rules” are subject to the warning schedule.

In accordance with the rules, the following rule breaks count for two warnings:

* RDM
* Combat Logging

Redux Staff reserves the right to deviate from the warning schedule in the event of serious rule breaks.

Warnings reset at the start of each new quarter. Bans started in previous quarters will run their full course,  
regardless of if the new quarter has begun (i.e. – if you are placed on a 3 day ban on March 31, you will still be banned until April 2nd).

| Quarter # | Months |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 1st Quarter | January - March |
| 2nd Quarter | April - June |
| 3rd Quarter | July - September |
| 4th Quarter | October - December |
