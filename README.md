# Welcome to Redux 2.5!

## Documentation

## Welcome to Redux Roleplay! To get started you will need to load FiveM and follow the instructions below:

> * Open your F8 Menu
> * Type in the following: `connect play.reduxdevelopment.org`
> * Once prompted click "Request Allowlist"

{% hint style="warning" %}
We have different rules than most cities, and it is imperative that you understand that it is your responsibility to stay up to date with all of the rules, and rule changes that happen. You can find the rules on our website located [HERE](https://roleplay.reduxdevelopment.org)
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Once you have completed these steps please allow the staff time to approve your request. They are typically pretty quick about this, but please allow sufficient time prior to attempting to tag them in Discord. Once your Allow List has been accepted you will be notified in the Allowlist Channel in Discord, and able to fly in to the server freely afterwards.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
PLEASE NOTE: If you do not fly into the city for 14 days you will need to reapply for your Allow List.
{% endhint %}

## Server Restart Times (MST+)

{% hint style="success" %}
